# Lab 1

The PixLab is the second lab of the year in AP Computer Science A.

You will be applying your knowledge of two dimensional arrays (along with previous concepts) to manipulate images, which are just 2D grids of colors (pixels).

We will also be covering two additional topics that will be on the AP Exam: binary (in Act 1) and enhanced for loops (in Act 5). 

At the end of the lab we will have an exam covering 2D arrays, binary, and enhanced for loops.
